The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.</p>\n<p>Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, \u201c11 takes\u201d. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card. With bull cards, you can play additional cards on your turn as long as all the cards fall within that ten point spread.

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no \u2018chance\u2019 element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.</p>\n<p>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham\u2019s 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, \u2018robber baron\u2019 oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.</p>\n<p>The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer).

Play proceeds in a series of stock rounds, each followed by a pair of operating rounds.  In stock rounds, players act as investors buying and selling stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, corporations will lay track, build stations, run trains for revenue to be paid out as dividends or withheld, and buy trains.  The majority shareholder of each corporation acts at its president, making all decisions during operating rounds.  Players will continue operating companies, collecting dividends, and reinvesting until the bank breaks.</p>\n<p>1846 features several unique elements, such as scaling the number of corporations, private companies, and bank size to the number of players.  Additionally, the traditional starting private company auction has been replaced with a private company draft, introducing hidden information and a degree of randomness.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters\u2019 pocket books in mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960\u2014a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon\u2019s lazy shave, President Eisenhower\u2019s late endorsement, and the \u2018Catholic question\u2019 are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state\u2019s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</article>"}, {"url": "https://bastardcafe.dk/games/1987-channel-tunnel/", "name": "1987 Channel Tunnel", "locations": [{"store": "Huset", "locale": "Shelf: 293"}], "raw": "<article class=\"col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 post-60479 games type-games status-publish hentry gv_type-game gv_complexity-medium\">\n<header>\n<h1 class=\"post-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1987 Channel Tunnel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n</header>\n<section class=\"article-content row\">\n<div class=\"thumbnail col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KUZAIwhKn-gR7gKkunvDNg__original/img/NgsRhiVqAz9ea_aSzHHGtiZv7Xo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4741327.jpg\"/> </div>\n<div class=\"description col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Published</th>\n<td>2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Type</th>\n<td>Game</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of players</th>\n<td>2 - 2 players</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Average duration</th>\n<td class=\"col-sm-5\">45 mins.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<td><img height=\"16\" src=\"https://bastardcafe.dk/wp-content/plugins/game-vault/assets/images/yellow.png\" width=\"16\"/> Medium\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Location</th>\n<td>\n<dl class=\"row mb-0\"><dt class=\"col-sm-3\">Huset</dt><dd class=\"col-sm-9\">Shelf: 293</dd></dl></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"game-description\">Description</h2>\n<p>For centuries, the relationship between Britain and France has been marked by wars and rivalries, but also by mutual alliances.

For weeks they wait, hoping to be rescued, but they slowly run out of food. They come to realize that if they ever want to get home again, they will have to take matters into their own hands. A raft is carefully put together and with a small ration four brave survivors try their luck on the Pacific, looking for salvation.

The purpose of the game is to have (at least) one of the survivors rescued by the rescue ship on the 21st day. You do this by following the events described in the logbook and having the survivors, represented by two stacked dice per survivor, choose and perform actions on the various locations on the game board by using their placement dice.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t lose too many planks of the raft or else you will lose some of your survivors as well! In 21 Days, the four survivors are stuck together on a raft made out of six planks that are held loosely together. Some events during the 21 days may cause some planks to drift off. There are ways to prevent this, like saving up hope tokens or picking the right bottle cards. When the rescue ship enters the final spot on the rescue track and there are still survivors left on the raft, you will be saved and win the game.</p>\n<p>21 Days is a dice-driven, Ameritrashy, game, so a lot depends on how you will roll the dice!

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.</p>\n<p>To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that\u2019s below the card\u2019s number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.</p>\n<p>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!</p>\n<p>6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</article>"}, {"url": "https://bastardcafe.dk/games/7-ages/", "name": "7 Ages", "locations": [{"store": "Huset", "locale": "Shelf: 907"}], "raw": "<article class=\"col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 post-60535 games type-games status-publish hentry gv_type-game gv_complexity-high\">\n<header>\n<h1 class=\"post-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 Ages\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n</header>\n<section class=\"article-content row\">\n<div class=\"thumbnail col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Kuwf88Na5ts58wYXzncRaA__original/img/u9ml7efxeBLz1BsC8R3au4o5t6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic670488.jpg\"/> </div>\n<div class=\"description col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Published</th>\n<td>2004</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Type</th>\n<td>Game</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of players</th>\n<td>2 - 7 players</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Average duration</th>\n<td class=\"col-sm-5\">480 mins.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<td><img height=\"16\" src=\"https://bastardcafe.dk/wp-content/plugins/game-vault/assets/images/red.png\" width=\"16\"/> Hard\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Location</th>\n<td>\n<dl class=\"row mb-0\"><dt class=\"col-sm-3\">Huset</dt><dd class=\"col-sm-9\">Shelf: 907</dd></dl></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"game-description\">Description</h2>\n<p>7 Ages is a game of world history from 4000 BC/E to 2000 AD/CE.

Each card also has a numeric value, used for making bids and trading. The game also features a system of a limited number of action options per player based on chits secretly selected by players each turn \u2014 for example, if you are playing more than one civilization, only one can declare war, only one can take production, etc. There is a \u201cwild\u201d chit each player can use to let two of his or her civilizations take the same action, but the civilization using the wild chit pays a penalty.</p>\n<p>Victory points and civilization levels are plotted using an on-board scoring area.

Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What\u2019s different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.</p>\n<p>Players do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it\u2019s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.</p>\n<p>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner\u2019s dominance in this area.</p>\n<p>You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent\u2019s capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent\u2019s capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately.

For the past 75 years, Viking raiding parties from Norway and Denmark have been terrorizing the coasts of England with \u2018hit and run\u2019 attacks. The treasures and stories gained from these attacks have allowed the Norsemen to raise huge hosts of eager men seeking glory and riches. These armies now stand poised to thunder across England where they will settle and farm the fertile land they conquer. The divided English kingdoms are unprepared for this impending onslaught. The Vikings are coming!</p>\n<p>In 878: Vikings \u2013 Invasions of England, players control the invading Vikings or the English nobles who are trying to withstand the invasion. Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers. The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings\u2019 household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders. The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities.</p>\n<p>Players for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies. Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win. The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn. The English players raise reinforcements from cities they control, while the Vikings must wait for a new invasion for reinforcements. The game ends when the Treaty of Wedmore is called and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</article>"}, {"url": "https://bastardcafe.dk/games/878-vikings-invasions-of-england-viking-age-expansion/", "name": "878 Vikings: Invasions of England \u2013 Viking Age Expansion", "locations": [{"store": "Huset", "locale": ""}], "raw": "<article class=\"col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 post-60579 games type-games status-publish hentry gv_type-expansion gv_complexity-undefined\">\n<header>\n<h1 class=\"post-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t878 Vikings: Invasions of England \u2013 Viking Age Expansion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n</header>\n<section class=\"article-content row\">\n<div class=\"thumbnail col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dE-fQ4qJd8ds67hjfKS3xQ__original/img/dF_yISrUSLBFH_Ox_zedpQJrIpM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3707047.jpg\"/> </div>\n<div class=\"description col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Published</th>\n<td>2017</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"25%\">Type</th>\n<td>Expansion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of players</th>\n<td>2 -

(a.k.a. Abluxxen), you take turns playing number cards, and the more cards of the same number you play, the better as cards score points at the end of the game. If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked! Stealing cards can be good, but if you can\u2019t use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they\u2019ll cost you points.</p>\n<p>In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player \u201cabluxxes\u201d those opponents \u2014 that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn\u2019t take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)</p>\n<p>As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent. Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins. If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</article>"}]
